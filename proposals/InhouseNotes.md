https://userportal.slac.stanford.edu/urawi/proposalForm.html?facility=LCLS&propType=I

 

Additional Guidelines & Considerations for Run 18 (similar to those for Run 17):

·         Limited technical resources available (minimize resource demands for in-house, make a clear case to justify needed resources…..)

·         Whys is this essential for Run 18? Priority for activities that are relevant for LCLS-II, or other clear need for time in Run 18

·         Demands on staff time and priority for LCLS-II preparation work (e.g. L2S-I instrument development)

 

For further info, attached are the slides from the discussion at the 9/12 SRD Science Meeting (or refer to the IH policy posted on the internal LCLS website: https://slacspace.slac.stanford.edu/sites/lcls/srd/Pages/in-house.aspx)
