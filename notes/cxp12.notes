32 pixels per clock cycle @ 250MHz clock 
8 bit pixels. 

OK, so 64e9 bits/sec means 8 GB/s

32 GB/s for all 4 boards



8 bits x 1024 pixels = 8192 bits
each line reports (Matt 256 bit number) (UI32 x4 and UI16 volume, and UI112 bit padding) (rise nad fall loc, rise and fall slope, area, and padding)
