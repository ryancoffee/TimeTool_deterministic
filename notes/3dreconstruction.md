# Knife Edges  

Use the scan to build a row-wise knife edge for horiz and vert independently. 
For each scan, sort the rows for edge position and assign the values to each row. 
Do the same for both vert and horiz. 
Also give each an intensity map that will serve as the scale factor for x-ray reconstruction. 
Rebuild the xy image from the parameters of the knife edge fits.
